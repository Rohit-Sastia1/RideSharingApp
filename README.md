# Ride Sharing App

RideSharingApp is a prototype Android application that simulates a basic ride-sharing experience. It integrates **Google Maps SDK** to show the user's live location and allows them to request a ride, which is recorded in **Firebase Realtime Database**. The app demonstrates key features of real-time location tracking, ride request logging, and simple backend communication.

## ðŸ“± Features

- Real-time user location tracking using Google Maps  
- Ride request functionality with one tap  
- Ride details stored in Firebase Realtime Database  
- Displays current location on map with camera zoom  
- Stores ride metadata including GPS coordinates, timestamp, and status  

---

## Architecture

- Activity: `MainActivity.java` manages map display and Firebase integration  
- Layout: XML includes a `SupportMapFragment` and a `Button` for ride request  
- Firebase: Used for real-time database updates to store and retrieve ride data  
- Location Services: Fused Location Provider is used for fetching user GPS data  


---

## ðŸ§  How it Works

1. The app asks for location permissions and loads a map centered on the user's current location.  
2. The user taps the "Request Ride" button to create a new ride request.  
3. The app captures the GPS coordinates and saves them to Firebase along with a status and timestamp.  
4. This structure can be extended to support driver assignment, tracking, and notifications.
